# Story 1.3: Basic Content Storage and Management

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure  
**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Sprint:** 1  

## Story

As a **content creator**,  
I want **to store and retrieve training program content securely**,  
so that **I can begin creating and managing training materials**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **1.3.1:** Content storage system is implemented with proper file organization and naming conventions
2. **1.3.2:** Basic CRUD operations are available for training program content
3. **1.3.3:** Content versioning system tracks changes and maintains history
4. **1.3.4:** File upload and download functionality supports common document formats (PDF, Word, PowerPoint)
5. **1.3.5:** Content metadata system stores information about training programs (title, description, language, client)
6. **1.3.6:** Basic search functionality allows users to find content by title, description, or metadata

## Dev Notes

### Technical Architecture Context

**Content Storage Stack:** [Source: architecture.md#content-storage]
- Primary Storage: Supabase Storage for files and documents
- Metadata Storage: PostgreSQL tables for content information
- File Types: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, images (JPG, PNG), video (MP4)
- Storage Organization: /client/{client_id}/programs/{program_id}/
- Content Versioning: Version numbers with change tracking

**Database Schema Extensions:** [Source: architecture.md#content-tables]
- training_programmes (already exists from Story 1.1)
- courses (already exists from Story 1.1) 
- modules (already exists from Story 1.1)
- units (already exists from Story 1.1)
- content_files (new) - file metadata and storage references
- content_versions (new) - version history tracking
- content_metadata (new) - additional metadata like tags, language

**Security Requirements:** [Source: architecture.md#content-security]
- Role-based file access (composers can create/edit, principals approve, clients view)
- File size limits (100MB per file, 1GB per program)
- Virus scanning for uploaded files
- Content encryption at rest

**Search and Indexing:**
- Full-text search on titles and descriptions
- Metadata-based filtering (language, client, status)
- Content type filtering
- Date range searching
