## Notes
- This is the foundational story that enables all subsequent development
- Focus on getting the basic infrastructure working before adding complexity
- Ensure all environment configurations work across development, staging, and production
- Database migrations should be reversible and properly tested
- CI/CD pipeline should catch issues early in the development process
