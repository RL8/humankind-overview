**Database Schema:** [Source: architecture.md#database-schema]
Core tables to be created:
- users (id, email, role, name, organization, created_at, last_login)
- training_programmes (id, title, description, status, client_id, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
- courses (id, programme_id, title, description, order_index, status, created_at)
- modules (id, course_id, title, content, order_index, language, status, created_at, updated_at)
- units (id, module_id, title, content, order_index, duration_minutes, created_at)
- comments (id, content_id, content_type, author_id, message, status, created_at)

**Environment Configuration:** [Source: architecture.md#environment-configuration]
Required environment variables:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL

## Notes
- This is the foundational story that enables all subsequent development
- Focus on getting the basic infrastructure working before adding complexity
- Ensure all environment configurations work across development, staging, and production
- Database migrations should be reversible and properly tested
- CI/CD pipeline should catch issues early in the development process
