# Story 1.2: User Authentication and Authorization

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure  
**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Sprint:** 1  

## Story

As a **user (composer, principal, or client)**,  
I want **to securely log in and access the platform with appropriate permissions**,  
so that **I can access only the features and content relevant to my role**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **1.2.1:** User registration and login functionality is implemented with secure password handling
2. **1.2.2:** JWT-based authentication system is implemented with proper token management
3. **1.2.3:** Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented for composers, principals, and clients
4. **1.2.4:** Password reset functionality is implemented with secure email verification
5. **1.2.5:** Session management includes automatic logout and token refresh capabilities
6. **1.2.6:** User profile management allows users to view and update their basic information

## Dev Notes

### Technical Architecture Context

**Authentication Stack:** [Source: architecture.md#authentication-flow]
- Authentication Provider: Supabase Auth
- Token Type: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Session Management: Supabase client-side session handling
- Password Security: bcrypt hashing via Supabase
- Email Verification: Supabase Auth email templates
- Role Management: Custom user metadata in Supabase Auth

**User Roles:** [Source: architecture.md#user-roles]
- **Composer:** Can create, edit, and manage training content
- **Principal:** Can view and approve training content, manage users within their organization
- **Client:** Can view assigned training content and track progress

**Database Schema:** [Source: architecture.md#database-schema]
- Users table already created in Story 1.1 with role, organization fields
- Supabase Auth handles core authentication, custom user metadata for roles

**Security Requirements:** [Source: architecture.md#security]
- All API routes require authentication except public endpoints
- Role-based middleware for route protection
- Secure password reset with time-limited tokens
- Session timeout after 24 hours of inactivity
- Token refresh before expiration
