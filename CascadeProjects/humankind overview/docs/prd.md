### Background Context
Mindstretchers Ltd. creates online training experiences for corporate clients worldwide, but currently faces significant challenges in their content creation and management process. The company needs to efficiently collaborate between internal composers and principals while also engaging clients during the authorship process. Additionally, they require a centralized system to manage training program content, adapt it for different clients, and handle multiple language versions efficiently.

The current manual translation workflows and fragmented content management processes are creating bottlenecks that prevent the company from scaling their training program delivery effectively. This platform will solve these challenges by providing a collaborative, multi-tenant system that enables seamless content creation, client engagement, and automated translation workflows.
