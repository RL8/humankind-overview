## Progressive Learning Pathway

### **Foundation → Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced**

**Course 1: {{module_title}}**
*The Philosophical Foundation*
Begin your transformation by understanding the revolutionary shift from traditional teaching to child-centered learning. You'll discover how to see children as natural researchers and capable thinkers, learning to ask questions that spark curiosity rather than test knowledge.

**Course 2: My First Floorbook & Talking Tub**
*From Theory to Practice*
Put your new understanding into action by creating your first documentation tools. You'll learn the practical skills of capturing authentic conversations, making children's thinking visible, and facilitating meaningful discussions. By the end, you'll have working Floorbooks and the confidence to engage children in rich dialogue about their discoveries.

**Course 3: Next Level Floorbooks & Talking Tubs**
*Sophisticated Practice*
Elevate your skills with advanced techniques that transform good documentation into extraordinary learning experiences. You'll master the art of creating deliberate provocations, facilitating sustained inquiries, and connecting learning across different experiences. This is where your practice becomes truly intentional and deeply impactful.

**Course 4: Mastering the Floorbook Approach**
*Leadership and Mastery*
Step into expertise and leadership, learning to create transformative environments, orchestrate complex conversations, and use documentation as living curriculum. You'll develop the skills to mentor others and contribute to the field, becoming a recognized leader in inquiry-based learning.
