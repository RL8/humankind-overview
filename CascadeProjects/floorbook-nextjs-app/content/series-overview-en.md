# Floorbook Approach - Complete Learning Series

## Series Overview

Welcome to a transformative professional learning journey that will revolutionize how you understand children, learning, and your role as an educator. The Floorbook Approach Learning Series is carefully designed as a progressive pathway that takes you from foundational philosophy to masterful practice, ensuring each step builds meaningfully on the previous one.

This comprehensive series recognizes that becoming an inquiry-based educator is not just about learning new techniques—it's about fundamentally shifting your mindset, developing sophisticated skills, and ultimately becoming a leader who can transform learning environments and mentor others. Each course is designed to meet you where you are while challenging you to grow beyond what you thought possible.

## Progressive Learning Pathway

### **Foundation → Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced**

**Course 1: Foundations of Inquiry-Based Learning**
*The Philosophical Foundation*
Begin your transformation by understanding the revolutionary shift from traditional teaching to child-centered learning. You'll discover how to see children as natural researchers and capable thinkers, learning to ask questions that spark curiosity rather than test knowledge. This foundation is essential—without this mindset shift, the techniques in later courses won't reach their full potential.

**Course 2: My First Floorbook & Talking Tub**
*From Theory to Practice*
Put your new understanding into action by creating your first documentation tools. You'll learn the practical skills of capturing authentic conversations, making children's thinking visible, and facilitating meaningful discussions. By the end, you'll have working Floorbooks and the confidence to engage children in rich dialogue about their discoveries.

**Course 3: Next Level Floorbooks & Talking Tubs**
*Sophisticated Practice*
Elevate your skills with advanced techniques that transform good documentation into extraordinary learning experiences. You'll master the art of creating deliberate provocations, facilitating sustained inquiries, and connecting learning across different experiences. This is where your practice becomes truly intentional and deeply impactful.

**Course 4: Mastering the Floorbook Approach**
*Leadership and Mastery*
Step into expertise and leadership, learning to create transformative environments, orchestrate complex conversations, and use documentation as living curriculum. You'll develop the skills to mentor others and contribute to the field, becoming a recognized leader in inquiry-based learning.
